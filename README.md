# Profit and Loss Analysis

## Description

This project involved creating code to analyse the profit/loss records of a company over a given period. The analysis included identifying the total number of months in the dataset (task 1), the net total amount of profit/losses over the period (task 2), calculating the average of the changes in profit/losses over the period (task 3), and identifying the greatest increase and decrease in profit/loss over the period (tasks 4 and 5).

The project criteria also specified that the code should print the analysis to the Console (task 6) and present the findings similar to as follows:

## Build

As per the project criteria, the analysis has been built using Javascript. Very minimal content and styling has been applied to the HTML file, as this was not required for the scope of the project.

The Javascript code has been commented throughout with pseudocode, breaking the project into tasks and sub-tasks (labelled as ‘TASKS’). Thorough comments to explain the developer’s understanding and rationale have also been included in the code (labelled as ‘WORKINGS’).

## Installation

## Usage

Users navigate to the webpage via the URL ([Profit and Loss Analysis](ADD LINK WHEN DEPLOYED). When on the webpage, the browser displays a heading of “Open the Console to view the Profit and Loss Analysis”.

Upon opening the Console, users can view the breakdown of the profit and loss analysis.

On Chrome browsers, with the Console opened to the bottom, the webpage will display as follows:

## Credits

Credit given to edX (2023) for providing the starter code.

Credit also given to Web Dev Cody (2020), whose YouTube video helped to work out the code for Task 2 (i.e. identifying the net total amount of profit/losses over the period), and to the responses on a FreeCodeCamp Forum (2019) which helped with aspects of Task 3 (i.e. ‘pushing’ values out of a loop into a new array) (credits also cited in code comments).

W3Schools’ (no date) explanations of the toFixed() method helped in Task 3 (i.e. returning value to two decimal places), while FreeCodeCamp’s (2016) article on finding the largest number in an array helped with Tasks 4 and 5 (credits also cited in code comments).
